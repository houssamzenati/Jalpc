  desc: >
          We  present YoTube, a novel network fusion  framework  for  searching  action  proposals  in  untrimmed
          videos. Our method consists of a recurrent YoTube detector and a static YoTube detector, where the recurrent
          YoTube explores the regression capability of RNN for candidate bounding boxes predictions using
          learnt temporal dynamics and the static YoTube produces the bounding boxes using rich appearance
          cues in a single frame. &#9733; Authors contributed equally.

          Memory networks model information and knowledge as memories that can be manipulated for
          prediction and reasoning about questions of interest. In many cases, there exists complicated
          relational structure in the data, by which the memories can be linked together into graphs to
          propagate information. Typical examples include tree structure of a sentence and knowledge graph
          in a dialogue system. In this paper, we present a novel graph enhanced memory network GEMN to
          integrate relational information between memories for prediction and reasoning.

  desc: >
          In this paper, we present a novel framework called TORNADO for human action proposal detection in untrimmed
          video clips. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal convolutional network that combines the advantages
          of regression-based detector and L-RCN by empowering Convolutional LSTM with regression capability.

- name: Search Video Action Proposal with Recurrent and Static YOLO
  i18n:

  desc: >
          In this paper, we propose a new approach for searching action
          proposals in unconstrained videos. Our method first produces
          snippet action proposals by combining YOLO detector and our regression
          based RNN detector. Then, these short action proposals are
          integrated to form final action proposals by solving two-pass
          dynamic programming which maximizes actioness score and temporal smoothness concurrently.
