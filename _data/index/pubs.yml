          We  present YoTube, a novel network fusion  framework  for  searching  action  proposals  in  untrimmed
          videos. Our method consists of a recurrent YoTube detector and a static YoTube detector, where the recurrent
          YoTube explores the regression capability of RNN for candidate bounding boxes predictions using
          learnt temporal dynamics and the static YoTube produces the bounding boxes using rich appearance
          cues in a single frame. &#9733; Authors contributed equally.

          Memory networks model information and knowledge as memories that can be manipulated for
          prediction and reasoning about questions of interest. In many cases, there exists complicated
          relational structure in the data, by which the memories can be linked together into graphs to
          propagate information. Typical examples include tree structure of a sentence and knowledge graph
          in a dialogue system. In this paper, we present a novel graph enhanced memory network GEMN to
          integrate relational information between memories for prediction and reasoning.
